 My Courses & Lessons App

Welcome to the **My Courses & Lessons App** project! This mobile application is being developed using **Flutter** in **Android Studio**. The primary aim of this app is to provide users with a seamless experience to browse, register, and access various courses and lessons. Although the project is still in development, it already includes a registration page that is linked with a WordPress site, as well as a basic login and home page.

 Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register through the app, and their details are seamlessly integrated with a WordPress-based backend.
- **User Login**: A simple login functionality that authenticates users and redirects them to the home page.
- **Home Page**: After logging in, users can access the home page, which displays a list of available courses.
- **Courses Display**: The home page currently lists the courses retrieved from the backend. Future updates will include more details about each course and lesson.


Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For building the cross-platform mobile application.
- **Dart**: As the primary programming language.
- **Android Studio**: For development and testing.
- **WordPress**: Backend integration for user registration and course management.
- **LearnDash**: LMS plugin for WordPress used for course and lesson management.
